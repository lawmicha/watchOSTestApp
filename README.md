## FAQ

**Issue**: When running `amplify init`, it could not detect the right folder structure of the xcode project. 
```
Updating Xcode project:
ðŸš« xcodeProject: Target watchOSTestApp not found
-- Recovery suggestion: Manually add Amplify files to your Xcode project.
ðŸ›‘ Command failed with exit code 1: /Users/xxxx/.amplify/lib/aws-amplify-amplify-frontend-ios/resources/amplify-xcode import-config --path=/Users/xxxx/temp/watchOSTestApp
```

This means we need to make sure the files we need for the app is added to the target. **amplifyconfiguration.json** and files generated from `amplify codegen models`

Generated files are located under `amplify/generated/models`

**amplifyconfiguration.json** located at the root
